For my final project, I chose to use resturant data in and around NYC.  I find that just the letter grade is often not enough to know if a place is good to eat at or not and always wanted something more akin to a searchable system when dining out.  For this project, i chose to use the data set from the NYC government website.  Because the SODA api only allows for a limited amount of rows to be pulled on each request, I wrote a function that would iteratively pull all the data from a data set, which i previously used on a different assignment, but repurporsed for here as well.  Once I had all the data loaded, I had to clean it by removing certain columns from the original list, and removing rows so that I would only be taking the most recent inspection for each place.  I also had to do some work removing resturants with blank scores or NaN score.  Finally, for my second visualization, i had to do an aggregation of the scores in order to make the chart even somewhat readable.
