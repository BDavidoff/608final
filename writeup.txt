For my final project, I chose to use resturant data in and around NYC.  I find that just the letter grade is often not enough to know if a place is good to eat at or not and always wanted something more akin to a searchable system when dining out.  For this project, i chose to use the data set from the NYC government website.  Because the SODA api only allows for a limited amount of rows to be pulled on each request, I wrote a function that would iteratively pull all the data from a data set, which i previously used on a different assignment, but repurporsed for here as well.  Once I had all the data loaded, I had to clean it by removing certain columns from the original list, and removing rows so that I would only be taking the most recent inspection for each place.  I also had to do some work removing resturants with blank scores or NaN score.  Finally, for my second visualization, i had to do an aggregation of the scores in order to make the chart even somewhat readable.
using the interactive map, i was surprised to see such a high concentration of C rated resturants so close to subway stops, but I guess that makes sense that these places would be the most unsanitary, and also the most resilient to bad reviews (since the people dining in them are probably fresh off the subway and don't care as much about where they are eating.)  It isn't surprinsg at all that staten island has the highest rate of badly inspected resturants, and that is the most far removed from the other boros and therefore, more likely to be lax with their cleaning.
There is almost more information about the writing of the code in the commit notes, if you care to take a look.
